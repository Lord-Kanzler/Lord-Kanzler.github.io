Roughly a months has passed since I wrote my first post on the Bridges to Prosperity Project. For anyone interested, the previous post can be found [here](https://alexkaiser.dev/2020-08-26-bridges-to-prosperity-labs25/). And since I'm not expecting anyone to go back and read an entire article just so that everything else makes sense, here a brief summary.

Bridges to Prosperity is a nonprofit organization that helps build footbridges in east african communities such as Rwanda. They have collected lots of data about various Rwandan villages and bridge sites, and have approached as with a request to help with building a tool allowing for the visualization of current and future bridge sites, with the inclusion of a predictive model determining and assess potential sites with a high social-economic impact on rural communities in the region.

At the beginning of the project we have been provided with extensive data sets on site assessments, as well as Rwandan administrative data, which ended up required tremendous amounts of preparation and cleaning in order to be merged into a single workable dataset. 

While my fellow DS colleagues took on the responsibility of data cleaning and merging, I took on more of a dev-ops role, focusing on setting up the API and providing data endpoints for the use by our web teams.
